# CGP-Project-Repo
- Repository for Computing Group Project
- Use this `README` as a checklist/overview for now

## Overview
- Our final goal is to come up with a working <u>chat and productivity application for teams/organizations</u>.
- Like any other chat application there are two main parts in the project:
  - **Server application** - The backend application where server management/administration takes place.
  - **Client application** - The frontend application where all the interations happen (and organizational administration).
- With this client-server approach we can provide the our application as a:
  - **SaaS (Software as a Service) model** - Offer our service on a centrally hosted platform by *us (the developers)* where the clients (users) only need to work with the client application while we handle the backend.
  - **Self-hosted software** - Users can setup their own private instance of our service by setting up the server application in private server/intra-net who wants complete control of their data with ease.
- Below are some examples with the same goal and provide their service as a SaaS model or as a self-hosted instance ([here](https://medium.com/@sravya.m60/top-10-team-chat-software-for-a-self-hosted-environment-specifically-designed-for-large-enterprises-e154fa653651) is a blog post on this):
